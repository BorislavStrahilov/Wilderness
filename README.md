# Wilderness

This is my current project (Spring 2016) that 
I've been working on since early in the semester. 
It is a 2D top down survival game that is still 
in its very early stages. I am currently using 
placeholder ground tile textures from a 
Minecraft texture pack at (http://www.minecrafttexturepacks.com/john-smith-legacy/)
I cannot thank Youtube user TheIndieDeveloper enough for his great
tutorial series on building a top down 2D game engine, his
videos were truly of great help and inspiration to what is currently
the Wilderness.
